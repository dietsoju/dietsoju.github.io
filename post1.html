          <article class="bodytextcontainer">

          <p class="bodytext">I remember back in 2012 when “Gangnam Style” was blocked by Maroon 5 from the Billboard Hot 100 number one spot. While “One More Night” was a well-deserved hit, people were excited to see a global phenomenon engrave Korean representation into music history. However, after weeks of arduous chart battles, it just didn’t pan out.<br><br>

A few years later, BTS made a considerable impression on the American music industry when they became the first K-pop group to score a top 10 hit back in 2018 with “Fake Love”. On August 31 of this year, they made history by becoming the first Korean act to hit Billboard number one with their most recent release, “Dynamite”; to date, the song has spent an additional two weeks at the top. After 8 years, it feels like things have finally come full circle for K-pop.<br><br>

While Korean artists have long been serious players in the global music market, it was not until recently that their presence in the Western world was acknowledged. Categories specifically for K-pop are emerging in American award ceremonies and Korean artists are increasingly making appearances on Western digital publications and television programs. Through constant social media buzz and ridiculously hardcore “streaming parties”, loyal fanbases put these Korean artists on the radar; as a result, Western audiences have slowly welcomed Hallyu into their lives.<br><br>

In a way, BTS hitting number one is a culmination of this long-lasting fight for Korean musical acts to be respected and celebrated in Western spheres. It also signifies a new generation in which Asian talent—even those outside of K-pop—can potentially assume positions of great regard and cultural impact. Yet, despite promises of a more diverse future for music, this victory still seems bittersweet to me.<br><br>

When I first listened to “Dynamite”, I immediately noticed that Jungkook’s introductory verse had way too many obvious references to American pop culture: Rolling Stone, King Kong and Lebron to name a few. The song's disco-pop sound is also reminiscent of something American artists such as Marc Ronson or Bruno Mars would have produced. The whole comeback, including the music video backdrops and styling, drew heavily from American motifs and nostalgia. And most surprisingly, the lyrics were written completely in English.

          As BTS has become a global boy group, it’s important for them to create records that reference other regions’ pop music trends to show love and appreciation for foreign listeners. So, in a way, through “Dynamite”, BTS was able to establish an even stronger relationship with their American fanbase. However, in trying to create a radio-friendly American pop song, BTS compromised the unique qualities that made their previous records so meaningful. <br><br>

I personally fell in love with BTS when I first watched a video clip of them winning Artist of the Year at the 2016 MAMA awards. RM’s speech especially moved me. He was crying, saying that no one believed they would make it and that they wish their songs can become the hopes and dreams of many across the world. There were definitely elements of sincerity, altruism and leadership in those words, values that I believe are well reflected in BTS’s diverse discography.

          <p class="bodytext">

            With their earlier recordings such as “N.O”, BTS empowered the voices of South Korean youth struggling to find their authentic selves in a society that favors conformity. In addition, a meticulously crafted and beautifully visualized “Love Yourself” album series encouraged listeners to find avenues of self-love, a message that I think BTS best encapsulated with “Idol”. Through this song, BTS was able to display traditional hanbok costumes and modern interpretations of pansori on a global stage, solidifying their roles as leading representatives of Korean culture and history. <br><br>

            Unfortunately, none of these messages and achievements are reflected in “Dynamite”. The lightweight lyrics and melody fail to fully display the extent to which BTS can manifest Korean culture and the zeitgeist of the younger generation. Up until now, BTS has been able to garner so much respect worldwide because of their ability to effectively communicate important messages while staying true to their heritage. That said, it’s hard to ignore the fact that BTS departed from their core artistic values in pursuit of increased stateside success. <br><br>

            However, considering the current status quo of Asian representation in Hollywood, this decision was most likely necessary for BTS to finally conquer the US charts. While Asian representation has seen considerable progress, the way in which Asian stories are told and the extent to which Asians can succeed are still subject to the preconceptions of White Hollywood. <br><br>

            The American media has a long-running history of inaccurately portraying—or even mocking—Asian people for the entertainment of their White audience. Whether it be through ridiculous “hai-ya”’s in martial arts movies or racist stereotypes displayed in sitcoms such as Fresh off the Boat, Hollywood has perpetuated a caricature of Asians that has greatly impacted the way in which Asians are perceived and treated in society. It is for this reason that K-pop artists are seen as “manufactured”, “gay” and “plastic”. While none of these things are inherently bad, Americans continue to exploit this rhetoric to portray Korean and other Asian societies as inferior, comical and distant. For as long as Asian societies continue to be characterized in a condescending manner, Asian entertainers and media that do not conform to the preferences of the American gaze will rarely realize mainstream success. Thus, despite their immense popularity, creating an English pop song was the only method through which BTS could truly prove their talent to and earn respect from an American audience. <br><br>

            While it’s difficult to dismantle and change an institution fortified by decades of prejudice, we can only hope that BTS can leverage their recent chart topper to further create opportunities for both themselves and other Asian artists to achieve commercial success with works of art that are more honest to the Asian experience. Only then will our stories be heard and the legacies of artists like BTS and PSY come to fruition.
